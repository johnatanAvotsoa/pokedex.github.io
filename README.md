# Pokedex JavaScript Project
## Overview
Welcome to my Pokedex JavaScript project! This web application utilizes the Poke API to create a Pokedex that lists all 151 Pokemon with their respective images and names. Throughout the development of this project, I have gained valuable experience working with the Poke API, utilizing the Fetch API, and mastering asynchronous programming by handling promises.

## Features
### Pokemon List: Displaying a comprehensive list of all 151 Pokemon.
### Images and Names: Each Pokemon is accompanied by its picture and name.
### Poke API Integration: Leveraging the Poke API to gather accurate and up-to-date information.

## Technologies Used
### JavaScript: The primary language for building the Pokedex logic.
### HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the web app for a user-friendly experience.
### Poke API: The external API providing Pokemon data.

## Learning Highlights
This project has provided hands-on experience in:
### Poke API Interaction: Learn how to fetch data from an external API.
### Fetch API: Understand the usage of the Fetch API for making network requests.
### Asynchronous Programming: Gain proficiency in handling promises for asynchronous operations.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the Poke API for providing a reliable source of Pokemon data and making this project possible.
